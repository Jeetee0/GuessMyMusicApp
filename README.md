# GuessMyMusic
This is a project for the HTW Berlin in the module: Mobile Anwendungen.

I am creating an App, where you can determine the BPM of a Song and then select the genre you are listening to.

I connected this project with my other Project: FrameModifier9001 (https://github.com/Jeetee0/FrameModifier9001).
In my app you can connect via ssh to my raspberry pi to control the FrameViewer from the other project.
Also i created a webservice in java to control the FrameViewer via REST communication.
I am also calling this webservice to get interprets that represent a specific genre.
